## Ethics Quest: Data Privacy and Security Board Game

- Ethics Quest is an educational board game designed to teach core principles of data privacy, security, and ethical decision-making through interactive gameplay. Developed as part of the DATA 605 Ethical Issues in Data Science course, the game transforms complex regulatory and ethical concepts into engaging, real-world scenarios. Players assume the roles of Privacy Officers navigating a dynamic journey of data protection challenges, earning “trust points” for effective and ethical decision-making.

- The game blends strategy, collaboration, and ethical reasoning, using challenge cards across five domains—Privacy, Security, Innovation, Ethics, and Compliance. Each scenario mirrors real-world data dilemmas, encouraging players to think critically about regulations, stakeholder impact, and organizational integrity. Unique game mechanics such as “Data Breach Events” and “Privacy Shields” simulate real incident management and promote teamwork under pressure.

- Developed through extensive research, playtesting, and expert feedback, Ethics Quest integrates principles of experiential learning and gamification to enhance understanding of data protection frameworks like GDPR and CCPA. The game has demonstrated strong educational impact, improving players’ awareness of ethical responsibilities and their ability to apply privacy principles in practical contexts.

- Future plans include digital and industry-specific adaptations expanding the game’s accessibility to sectors like healthcare and finance, and integrating it into privacy training programs and academic curricula. Ethics Quest stands as a model for innovative, engaging, and effective ethics education in the age of data-driven decision-making.
